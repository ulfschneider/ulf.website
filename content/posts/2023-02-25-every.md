While straying around in Oliver´s font friday archive, his [review of the Every font](https://pimpmytype.com/every/) sprang to my eye. The font is made by Anita Jürgeleit and you can [get Every at her TypeThis!Studio](https://www.typethis.studio/p/every-font-family/). To me it feels like an elegant and well crafted *workhorse* type.

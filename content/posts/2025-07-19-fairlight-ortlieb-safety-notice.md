Fairlight recently issued a [safety notice](https://fairlightcycles.com/product-safety-notices/?v=5f02f0889301) regarding the Ortlieb QLS Fork Pack Mounting System attached to Fairlight Secan carbon forks. The Ortlieb system can damage your Fairlight carbon fork if you do not mount it by following  the [Ortlieb installation instruction](https://downloads.ortlieb.com/instructions/fork_pack.pdf). Specifically, **==you have to fit the parts G and H!==** If parts G and H are not fitted, the fork rack system will sit against the body of the fork (rather than against the attachment bosses) and ==potentially affect the fork’s integrity, which can lead to compromised rider safety==. If you have ever fitted the QLS Fork Pack Mounting System without parts G and H, ==stop riding the affected fork and contact Fairlight immediately==.

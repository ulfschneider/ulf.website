[<cite>PagesCMS</cite>](https://pagescms.org) is a CMS for static sites hosted on GitHub that looks interesting. It is MIT-licensed and made by [Ronan Berder](https://ronanberder.com). There is a [online version](https://app.pagescms.org/) to hook into, but it is as well possible to host it yourself.

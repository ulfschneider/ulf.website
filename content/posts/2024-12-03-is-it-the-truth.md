A friend from the cycling club, who organized the [Paderborn Buffalo Bike Charity Ride](/2024-05-26-buffalo-bike-charity-ride/), presented the four Rotary guiding principles during our clubs recent end-of-year meetup. The principles can be applied in any situation and are designed to promote integrity, fairness, and positive relationships. Ask yourself:

1.	Is it the truth?
2.	Is it fair to all concerned?
3.	Will it build goodwill and better friendships?
4.	Will it be beneficial to all concerned?

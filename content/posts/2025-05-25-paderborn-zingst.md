## The route

<figcaption>My route from Paderborn to Zingst, which I planned with komoot collections. I divided the route into the following four stages:
<ol>
<li>Paderborn to Landesbergen, 127 km, 876 m up</li>
<li>Landesbergen to Bad Bevensen, 150 km, 546 m up</li>
<li>Bad Bevensen to Wismar, 155 km, 804 m up</li>
<li>Wismar -> Zingst, 132 km, 537 m up</li>
</ol>

## Day 1, Paderborn to Landesbergen

The route went from Paderborn, over Detmold, Lemgo, and Minden to Landesbergen. At first I wanted to ride 10 km further to Nienburg, but the the Mühlengasthof Landesbergen looked inviting to stay for the night, therefore I cut off the route at 127 km for the day.

<figcaption>Arrival at the Mühlengasthof Landesbergen, my destination for the first day of the journey. I recommend the Mühlengasthof for a stay, because my room was comfortable, the food was good, the location is calm and friendly, and I enjoyed having an interesting conversation with one of the two owners. During the breakfast of the next day I met two other cyclists and we had another interesting conversation about bike riding and how the bike must conform to the rider and how the rider has to adapt to the demands of a multi-day bike journey.</figcaption>

## Day 2, Landesbergen to Bad Bevensen

The second day took me eastward across long stretches of the Südheide. I enjoyed riding over the sandy soil through the rather remote landscape. Destination for the day was Bad Bevensen.

## Day 3, Bad Bevensen to Wismar

The third day brought me north, crossing Naturpark Wendland, Dannenberg, Ludwigslust, then Schwerin, ending Wismar. I felt the route was long and not varied, with the exception of the part from Schwerin to Wismar, which goes along Lake Schwerin and is beautiful.

<figcaption>Traces of human life along the way. It moves me to see how people shape their surroundings by creating buildings that will change and decay over decades or centuries. Whoever built the Schwerin Castle is not alive anymore. And it doesn´t need to be a castle.  The people who created the bus shelter to make life easier for their fellow human beings, they had families, raised children, built houses themselves, and it could be they are no longer with us.</figcaption>

## Day 4, Wismar to Zingst

The last day of this journey started on a cold but sunny morning in Wismar. From there I rode in eastern direction along the coast of the baltic sea passing through Kühlungsborn, Heiligendamm, Warnemünde (where I made a quick ferry crossing), then riding further through the Ribnitzer Moor, and finally arrived in Zingst.

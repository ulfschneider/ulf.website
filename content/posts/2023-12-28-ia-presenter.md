[<cite>iA Presenter</cite>](https://ia.net/presenter) is a unique tool made by iA that relies on text and Markdown and is meant to support you in presentation situations. 

While the output of [<cite>iA Writer</cite>](/2023-12-28-ia-writer/), the other tool made by iA,  might be consumed with all kinds of apps, an important output format of iA Presenter is the presentation format. It is not strictly required to give your talk with the help of iA Presenter, because you can export to other formats, but it´s beneficial to leverage the tool in the presentation situation.

During your preparation of a talk, iA Presenter will help you to focus on your story and message first, and not to loose time with the drawing of slides. You will start to develop that story in plain text (Markdown) and evolve a structure and key messages. Once you reached the point of having those key messages, iA Presenter will help with its auto layout feature to visualize each message beautifully typeset on screens of any size . The focus on *text first,* and the usage of *auto layout,* speeds up the creation time of presentations. 

> [!NOTE]
> You don´t get a drawing tool with iA Presenter. Should you need graphical visualizations, you have to create them with  any other tool you find appropriate, and then import your graphics as images into your iA Presenter story.

During the presentation, iA Presenter will help with a teleprompter that will show you the text that is not shown along with your message, but will support your key message. The presentation window itself, which is a different window than the teleprompter window, can be shared and resized  in online scenarios without covering other parts of your computer screen. You get a *responsive* visualization that will adapt to the size and format of your presentation window.

Meaningful handouts are quick to produce because you focused on text first during creation time. 

Export formats are available for PDF,  HTML, and even a Microsoft PowerPoint export is available (don´t expect a 1:1 visualization).

While I have to improve my skills, I enjoyed creating these tiny things very much: [<cite>Serverless</cite>](/2023-08-01-serverless/), [<cite>Agile. Learn as you go</cite>](/2023-05-17-agile-ia-presenter/), and [<cite>Docker and Kubernetes</cite>](/2023-06-13-docker-kubernetes/).

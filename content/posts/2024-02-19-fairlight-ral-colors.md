My Strael has a tiny spot on the frame that I want to repair with a touch-up pen. Because I didn´t know what RAL color comes closest I wrote a quick mail to the nice folks at Fairlight. David sent an immediate reply and  pointed out, the information can be found for all colors on their [FAQ page](https://fairlightcycles.com/frequently-asked-questions/). From the FAQ:

> Please always test the colour prior to application – all of these colours are matched on a best efforts basis so there will be a slight discrepancy between your frame and the touch up paint

Fairlight suggests to buy touch-up pens at [touchuppaintfactory.co.uk](https://touchuppaintfactory.co.uk). For Germany, [lackstift24.de](https://www.lackstift24.de/) or [lackstift-shop.de](https://www.lackstift-shop.de/ ) might also be solutions.

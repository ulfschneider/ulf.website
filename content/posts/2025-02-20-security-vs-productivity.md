Ben Werdmüller´s post [<cite>Ask a CTO: security vs. productivty; when to adopt technology trends</cite>](https://werd.io/2025/ask-a-cto-security-vs-productivity-when-to-adopt-technology) resonates. A good IT strategy is rooted in service design.

> Security and productivity don’t have to be at odds: they should reinforce each other. They’re not at different ends of a continuum. […]  the worst IT policies are created by people who do something because they think they should, perhaps because they perceive that other people are doing them. Do you really need to rotate your passwords every 90 days? (I’ll spare you a search: [the answer is no](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/problems-forcing-regular-password-expiry.) […] if you don’t implement these things from a human-centered perspective, people are going to resent the changes, and you run the risk of getting in the way of people’s work.

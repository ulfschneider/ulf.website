> We have heard about new ways of developing software by paying consultants and reading Gartner reports. Through this we have been told to value:
>
> - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools 
>   and we have mandatory processes and tools to control how those individuals (we prefer the term ‘resources’) interact
> 
> - Working software over comprehensive documentation
>   as long as that software is comprehensively documented
> 
> - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
>   within the boundaries of strict contracts, of course, and subject to rigorous change control
> 
> - Responding to change over following a plan
>   provided a detailed plan is in place to respond to the change, and it is followed precisely
> 
> That is, while the items on the left sound nice in theory, we’re an enterprise company, and there’s no way we’re letting go of the items on the right.

Agreed:

> Design is about clarity, not cleanliness. […] Design that prioritises aesthetics over usability is not good design. […] ChatGPT pulls unreliable, uninformed and untrustworthy design advice from the internet and delivers it with confidence.

Adam´s most recent newsletter not only is a lesson in what design is about, it also tells how to use tools like ChatGPT. [<cite>AI is good at input</cite>](/2023-07-16-ai-for-input/), not output. You cannot take a ChatGPT response, use it as output and present it to your users. You might use it as one source of input and process it to come to *your* output.

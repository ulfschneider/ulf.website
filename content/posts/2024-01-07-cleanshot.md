[<cite>CleanShot</cite>](https://cleanshot.com) is a powerful and customizable tool to capture images and record GIF´s and videos on a Mac screen. I cannot count all the productivity features offered, some outstanding:

- Capture an area with the default Mac shortcut <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>⌘</kbd> <kbd>4</kbd>.
- Get an all-in-one CleanShot capturing frontend with <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>⌘</kbd> <kbd>5</kbd>. 
- Set dimensions and ratios for the capturing of areas.
- Hide desktop icons when capturing the screen.
- Annotate screenshots.
- Record GIF and video.
- See a capture history.
- Upload captured data into the cloud and share it from there.

It´s hard to think of a use case that is not supported in an excellent way by the tool. Calling it a screen capturing tool is understatement.

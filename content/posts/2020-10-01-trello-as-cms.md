title: Using Trello as a Super Simple CMS

In his [CSS-Tricks article](https://css-tricks.com/using-trello-as-a-super-simple-cms/), Phil describes a very nice and generic approach to use 11ty data files for fetching contents from Trello. 

Phil doesn´t talk about how to create dedicated pages from each data entry (from each Trello card). A solution to that is given in the 11ty documentation: [pages from data](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/pages-from-data/).

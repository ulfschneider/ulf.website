Zack Leatherman published [ONE YOUTUBE EMBED WEIGHS ALMOST 1.2 MB](https://www.zachleat.com/web/youtube-embeds/) and pointed to the much better `lite-youtube` web component by Paul Irish, which will bring an embedded YouTube down to 2.5 % of the original embedding code! `lite-youtube` loads *much*  faster and will save *a lot of* bandwidth.

To simplify the usage with 11ty, I´ve written a small plugin, named [<cite>eleventy-plugin-lite-youtube</cite>](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eleventy-plugin-lite-youtube), which will leverage Paul Irish´s web component for easy and superfast YouTube video embedding.

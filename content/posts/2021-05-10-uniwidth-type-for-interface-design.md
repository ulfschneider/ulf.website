Uniwidth is not the same as monospace! Monospace is non-proportional, meaning each letter occupies the same amount of space. Uniwidth is proportionally spaced, meaning each letter occupies a different amount of space, but the space for each letter is the same across all font-weights and font-styles.

A uniwidth typeface allows using weights to indicate different label states  â€“ without altering the amount of space the label occupies inside of the layout. This is a valuable feature for [functional text](/2021-02-07-how-to-pick-a-typeface-for-interface-text/) in screen design, like for headers and menu bars.

Lisa Staudingers article [<cite>Uniwidth typefaces for interface design</cite>](https://uxdesign.cc/uniwidth-typefaces-for-interface-design-b6e8078dc0f7) is an excellent guide into the topic. In addition, Lisa provides many links for uniwidth typefaces, like for example

[<cite>Plantin</cite>](https://catalog.monotype.com/family/monotype/plantin) by Monotype is such a beautiful serif old style typeface. I like especially the plain roman and the expressive italic styles. I came across when visiting the homepage of [Ash Huang](https://ashsmash.com). Plantin in use can be found at [typewolf](https://www.typewolf.com/plantin).

P.S.
: Beginning of January 2023 Nils Hempel made me aware of [Plantijn](http://scriptorium.blog/Plantijn/) by [Wouter Soudan](http://rhythmus.be). WouterÂ´s Plantijn seems to have the most complete set of glyphs and as well a lot of font features, but I could not find a way to buy the font. Probably one has to contact Wouter and ask about it.

P.P.S.
: [ET Book](https://edwardtufte.github.io/et-book/) is a free font and could be an alternative to Plantijn. ET Book is not as bold as Plantin and to my taste the Plantin glyphs are more pleasant. Look at a quick comparation at [Identifont](http://www.identifont.com/differences?first=Plantin+Schoolbook&second=Bembo+Schoolbook). ET Book is used by Jeremy Keith for his book [Resilient Web Design](https://resilientwebdesign.com).

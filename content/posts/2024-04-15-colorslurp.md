My color picker is [<cite>ColorSlurp</cite>](https://colorslurp.com). I use the pro version, for which I did a one-time purchase. I think that way of purchasing is not available anymore. Now you have to subscribe a yearly subscription and I think the subscription is expensive. I´m not sure if I would go down that route. 

The features are good:

- The basic picking of a color from the screen is unobtrusive. Start picking with the keyboard command <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>⌘</kbd> <kbd>M</kbd> (you can adjust the shortcut). You can as well open ColorSlurp through the Menu Bar or the Dock. 
- Picking a color is supported by a magnifier. The magnifier can be configured in size and how much it magnifies (zoom level).
- Recently picked colors are available in a short list and you can configure in what format the colors are copied to the clipboard when clicking on a color. My format is HEX.
- You can check WCAG contrast of two colors .
- You can create palettes from picked colors, by manually adding a color, or by extracting colors from an imported image. The palettes can be synced via iCloud among your devices.
- Every palette color automatically receives a name, like *Gold Drop, Galliano, Jumbo, and the like*. You can overwrite those names.
- Colors from palettes can be copied into multiple different formats to reuse them in a different context (e.g.: HEX, CSS HSLA, CSS RGBA, and others I have never used nor seen before).
- Palettes can be exported in CSS format, plain text, PDF, images, and even as an iPhone wallpaper, to share them.

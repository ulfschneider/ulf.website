In our team everyone can ask to have a concept or anything of interest explained by a colleague who might know _at least something_ about it. It´s really not formal – it´s more that we are trying to help each other to understand the things around us better. This time it is on me to say something about _Serverless_. Here are my prepared materials: <a href="/assets/serverless/index.htm"><cite>Serverless</cite></a>

## ChatGPT Summary of the presentation

This presentation discusses the concept of serverless computing and its evolution within the world of technology. Here's a summary of the key points:

- Serverless computing is a development approach where developers do not need to manage or interact with servers directly.
- It marks the final stage in the evolution of virtualization, following hardware servers, virtual machines, and containers.
- The traits of each evolutionary step are outlined:
  - Hardware servers require physical installation and administration.
  - Virtual machines decouple from hardware, can be prepared once, and are administered.
  - Containers are more lightweight, can be distributed easily, and start quickly but still require administration.
  - Serverless abstracts away servers, requires minimal administration, relies on cloud providers, is priced by usage, and scales automatically.
- Serverless covers various aspects, such as functions, storage, authentication, monitoring, and alerting, putting the focus on business logic.
- Serverless is known for its reliability, speed, and global availability.

This presentation encourages us to consider the shift to serverless as a significant advancement in cloud computing.

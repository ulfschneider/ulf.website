I learned three things from Chris Coyier´s [article](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/lazygit/):

1. [<cite>Lazygit</cite>](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) is a terminal UI (TUI) for git. It is written in GO by Jesse Duffield and it works cross-platform!  I installed it via homebrew with `brew install lazygit` on my Mac. From then on, when I´m in the terminal inside of a Git repo, typing the command  `lazygit` will start the tool. It´s impressive what Jesse is doing here.

2. TUI is the abbreviation for Terminal UI.
3. There are libraries specialized to create TUI´s, like the libs on [charm.sh](https://charm.sh), which are written in GO.

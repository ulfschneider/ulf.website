When you are in the Terminal on a Mac inside of a Git repository, and you use the [Fork Git client](https://git-fork.com), it´s perfectly doable to open the current repo in Fork by issuing the command:

```sh
fork .
```

As a one-time prerequisite, install the Fork Command Line Tools from the Fork menu bar by navigating to Fork → Install Command Line Tools.

From any folder within the terminal, to open the current folder in the Finder, issue the command:

```sh
open .
```

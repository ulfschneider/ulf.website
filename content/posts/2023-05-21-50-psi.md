After riding my Strael for about a year, I´ve settled with a pressure of 50 psi for the 30 mm Continental GP 5000 tires on the Dura Ace C36 Wheelset. I started out with 60 psi, which feels harder.

Note on 11 Jun, 2024: After going down from 60 psi to 50 psi I increased pressure back to 58 psi. 50 psi felt too low for  cornering. I still ride the same tires.

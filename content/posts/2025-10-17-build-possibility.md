This sounds true! When deciding to buy or to build a software solution, build what makes you special, what differentiates you.

> Getting your build vs buy balance right is how you achieve table stakes: stable infrastructure, reliable publishing, sustainable engineering. But that sets you up for *today*. In order for any business to future-proof itself, it needs to make a bet on what the future will look like and build for *that*.

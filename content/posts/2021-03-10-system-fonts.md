Iain Bean writes in his article [<cite>System fonts don’t have to be ugly</cite>](https://iainbean.com/posts/2021/system-fonts-dont-have-to-be-ugly/) about system fonts vs. web fonts. He is giving an overview of available system fonts on different platforms, like Georgia, Charter, Palatino, Hoefler Text, San Francisco, and Segoe UI. That alone is valuable to know. In addition, Iain has a comprehensive list of reference links in the footer of his text, which by itself is a gem, especially

- [<cite>Web fonts: when you need them, when you don´t</cite>](https://medium.com/hackernoon/web-fonts-when-you-need-them-when-you-dont-a3b4b39fe0ae), which contains a decision tree for when to use a web font and plenty of advice how to load fonts, and
- [<cite>System fonts</cite>](https://practicaltypography.com/system-fonts.html) on Butterick´s practical typography^[[<cite>Butterick´s practical typography</cite>](https://practicaltypography.com) is such a beautifully styled website – the (non-)use of color, the styling of ordered and unordered lists, the side panels, the usage of typography (of course). *Great!*].

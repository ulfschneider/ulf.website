Dave Rupert posted [<cite>Play at work</cite>](https://daverupert.com/2024/01/play-at-work/). The text is of course not about having a table soccer in the office and spending time playing during office hours. It´s about cultivating a habit of *serious play* at work, to grow individually and as a team, aiming for best possible solutions. It´s about exploring what´s in your tools, understanding the materials you have to handle, finding the solution that will serve your users best, and having meaningful and responsible team interaction.

I fully agree to the idea of *serious play*. 

> Sometimes play is being on my own with high autonomy and low consequences, sometimes it’s getting to choose new and fun technologies, but where play is most valuable is when it involves other people.

One thing that has served me well in my working life, and still does, is a behaviour described as [<cite>The Hot Potato Process</cite>](https://danmall.com/posts/hot-potato-process/), <q>where ideas are passed quickly back and forth from designer to developer and back to designer then back to developer for the entirety of a product creation cycle</q>. It´s not a waterfall process where a designer has to get the design right in the first pass and the developer will pick up the design and *simply* builds it. 

At a side note, the currently popular Figma has a tendency to [push development teams into the waterfall direction](/2023-06-28-move-on-from-figma/) and for that reason I prefer to avoid Figma in web development projects. Instead, I like to work with the materials at hand, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (TypeScript), and improve continuously. It avoids handoff and allows to adhere to what really lays in the materials.

Agile is a way of interpreting the hot potato process.

The first value of the agile manifesto says:

> Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.

The agile team is *encouraged to actively evolve* how the work is done. If you look at it this way, a team role named *Scrum Master* can be an impediment and might hinder the team to evolve! I´m not saying Scrum is false or Scrum is not agile. Scrum can work. If you are doing it by following the process rules without finding ways to each other, and without acknowledging the current situation, it´s theater communication and the members of the team will behave accordingly and protect themselves. The team is doing [faux-agile](https://daverupert.com/2019/03/the-state-of-agile-software-in-2018/). It´s theater communication with agile names and rituals, but without the [values](http://agilemanifesto.org). It´s waterfall with standups. Industries are making money with agile certifications and agile frameworks that do pretty much that: [waterfall with new names](https://www.halfarsedagilemanifesto.org).

<figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_y2pNj0zZg"><cite> The State of Agile Software in 2018</cite></a>, by Martin Fowler. Martin, being one of the original signatories of the agile manifesto, is articulating the issues that come with the hype of agile, or should I say enterprise agile? Despite the talk being from 2018, the content is relevant and probably will always be. Martin states at 23:20 that Kent Beck wanted to give agile the name "conversational", and I like that very much. As a developer you want to talk to users first name. Suggestions by Martin:
<ul>
<li>Get rid of the agile industrial complex and let go of imposing agile processes on teams</li>
<li>Raise the importance of technical excellence</li>
<li>Organize around products and not around software projects</li>
</ul> 
The <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/agile-aus-2018.html ">transcription of the talk</a> is on Martin´s blog.  </figcaption>

It´s a pitty the successful concept of agile has been taken over by corporations emphasizing processes over individuals and interactions, but perhaps it was inevitable. Once agile became popular, a way to make money out of it appeared, and money-seekers were jumping onto it. Managers where jumping onto it because it became the valid thing, because all others transitioned to an agile-named process. When you find yourself in a context where agile is being practiced by seizing power on developers, squeezing more features out of a delivery team in a given time, I´m sorry for you and I hope you find a way to change that. But it doesn´t render agile false. Agile is serious play and it´s worth seeking for this way of working - you don´t need to name it agile and probably it will not help you with your management to name it serious play. Instead, I hope you find a way of just doing what you came for, building and making something beautiful and meaningful together with your colleagues. You don´t need to give it a name.

Dave ends his text with a sentiment, <q>Maybe we need more play at work.</q> This is not a question to me. In software development, it´s the way forward.

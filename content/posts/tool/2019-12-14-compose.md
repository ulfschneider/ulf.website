[Compose CSS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/compose-css) is a personal investigation and tools-building effort. I´m trying to find out for myself what is useful to have in a CSS library and how that lib should be structured. *{{site.name}}* is created by using Compose CSS. Compose CSS will probably change drastically and often until I find something that´s working for me.

I´m inspired by *[Heritage of Kumiko Crafts](https://youtu.be/-NuqwJz9RNE).* You can watch there how the craftsmen have created their own very specific tools for very specific jobs – which is what I´m aiming to do with Compose CSS for my web development.

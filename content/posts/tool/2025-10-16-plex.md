[iA Presenter](https://ia.net/presenter) is my favorite software for writing and presenting a *story*. Presenter comes with a set of themes to provide a suitable visual style for your message. You can add your own *custom themes* to fit the tool even better to your needs. That´s what I did with Plex: It is a custom iA Presenter theme based on the IBM Plex® typeface with vibrant dynamic background colors.

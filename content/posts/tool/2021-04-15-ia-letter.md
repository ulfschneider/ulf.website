## Install

1. [Download the template](https://github.com/ulfschneider/ia-writer-letter/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
2. Open the folder named <code>ia-writer-letter-master</code>.
3. Double-click on the *bundle* named <code>letter.iatemplate</code>. The bundle will then be installed inside of iA Writer. Please refer to [iA-Writer-Templates](https://github.com/iainc/iA-Writer-Templates) for further information.


## A sample letter

See below a markdown-formatted letter in the iA Writer editor, with indication for the *sender-address,* the *receiver-address,* and the *date* of writing. The sample text is taken from [Purdue Online Writing Lab](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/professional_technical_writing/basic_business_letters/sample_letters.html).

The *Letter* template will render the text with the *iA Writer Quattro* typeface. For letters printed on DIN A4 paper – or anything of roughly the same size – the sender, receiver, and the date of writing will be positioned correctly. See below how the above text is formatted by the *Letter* template.

## The editor

Indicate the sender, receiver, and date of writing with the following syntax in the iA Writer editor. Please mind the *empty lines before and after each data entry.*

~~~markdown
@sender
:Lucy Letter
:27 Writing Avenue 
:12345 Garden Town

@receiver
:Ernie English
:78 Reading Lane
:34567 Read City

@date
:April 15, 2021
~~~

- Instead of the `@sender` keyword, `@from` can be used as well.
- Instead of the `@receiver` keyword, `@recipient` and `@to` can be used alternatively.

## Content blocks

iA Writer allows to use [content blocks](https://ia.net/writer/support/general/content-blocks). These play nicely together with the `@sender` and `@receiver` functionality. E.g., if you have a file `ernie.md`, with contents:


~~~markdown
:Ernie English
:78 Reading Lane
:34567 Read City
~~~

and another file `lucy.md`, with contents:

~~~markdown
:Lucy Letter
:27 Writing Avenue 
:12345 Garden Town
~~~

your letter can be written in the form:

~~~markdown
@sender
/lucy.md

@receiver
/ernie.md

@date
:April 15, 2021
~~~

which is shorter, quicker, less error prone, and allows you to maintain a list of more often used addresses :-).

[<cite>qrvc</cite>](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ulfschneider/qrvc) is a command line tool that allows to prepare a QR code from vCard data.

</figure>

One way to create the QR code is by providing a vCard file as input and process that. If you do not have a vCard file, **qrvc** will ask you for data input and will then create a vCard file and a QR code for you.

Your data remains on your computer and nowhere else.

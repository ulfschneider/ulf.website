[<cite>qrvc</cite>](https://github.com/ulfschneider/qrvc) is a command line tool that allows to prepare a QR Code from vCard data. One way to create the QR Code is by providing a vCard file as input and process that. If you do not have vCard file, **qrvc** will ask you for data input and will then create a vCard file and a QR Code for you.

Your data remains on your computer and nowhere else.

## Installation and usage

When you have the `go` programming language installed on your computer, you simply issue the following command in the shell to get **qrvc** built and installed:

```sh
go install github.com/ulfschneider/qrvc@latest
```

The most simple use is then by just calling:

```sh
qrvc
```

You can do more things! Get a list of available options through:

```sh
qrvc -h
```

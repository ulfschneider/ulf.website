A [markdown-it plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it-fitmedia) to set aspect-ratio of responsive images, make images lazy loading, and to make videos responsive. The original idea goes back to [FitVids.js](http://fitvidsjs.com) and the [evolutionary improvements](https://daverupert.com/2023/10/fitvids-has-a-web-component-now/) that were possible because browsers improved.

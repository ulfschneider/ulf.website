Andy Bell is documenting the (re-)design process of the [piccalil.li](https://piccalil.li/blog/redesigning-piccalilli-the-first-part-of-the-design-process) site.

Notes:

1. Andy´s agency, [Set Studio](https://set.studio), starts with priority guides, which have been described by Heleen van Nues and Lennart Overkamp in the 2018 A List Apart article [<cite>Priority Guides: A Content-First Alternative to Wireframes</cite>](https://alistapart.com/article/priority-guides-a-content-first-alternative-to-wireframes/). Andy strongly recommends reading the text and I fully agree. I´m a fan of priority guides too. Advantages of this technique over wireframes: 
	 - more user centered,
	 - more team engagement,
	 - suitable for responsive design, 
	 - the process is content first and therefore you do not waste time with aesthetics and layout, 
	 - visual designer creativity is facilitated,
	 - a priority guide is similar to HTML and might even be created early on with HTML.
2. The process Andy and team are using is in itself part of a web-based system that is a deployable, accessible website which houses all the deliverables.
3. Figma is used for ideation and design research, ==but not to do the complete design==. They jump quickly from Figma to HTML-based prototypes. In Figma, they do:
   - mood boards for inspiration and possible conceptual directions,
   - typography (fonts for headings, sub-headings, and body text, typographic scales, leading, spacing) and color exploration,
   - loose look and feel concepts that could feel like pages, but are not page designs, it´s with a focus on visuals.
4. After ideation they start with HTML and CSS prototypes, which are 100% disposable, but use already semantic HTML.

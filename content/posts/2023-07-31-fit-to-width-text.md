[<cite>Fit-to-Width Text</cite>](https://kizu.dev/fit-to-width-text/) with scroll-driven animations by Roman Komarov. Don´t be mislead by the term scroll-driven – it´s only the CSS technique to achieve the effect. A very detailed explanation and hinting of limitations (e.g., a min font-size cannot be set).

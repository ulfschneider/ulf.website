The [<cite>System Color Picker</cite>](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/system-color-picker/id1545870783?mt=12) by Sindre Sorhus is an excellent alternative to my [ColorSlurp](/2024-04-15-colorslurp/). The System Color Picker is a free tool as opposed to the expensive ColorSlurp. Yet, System Color Picker has excellent features, such as:

- Picking a color with a magnifying glass by using a keyboard shortcut that can be freely configured
- Showing and hiding the app window with a freely configurable keyboard shortcut
- Support of color formats Hex, HSL, RGB, OKLCH and LCH
- Defining a preferred color format
- Creating color palettes
- A set of four starting palettes (Apple, Crayons, System, Web Safe Colors)

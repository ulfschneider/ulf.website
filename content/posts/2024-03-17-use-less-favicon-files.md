Andrey Sitnik explains how *not* to use 20+ files just for favicons: [<cite>How to Favicon in 2024: Six files that fit most needs</cite>](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/how-to-favicon-in-2021-six-files-that-fit-most-needs) on the Evil Martians blog.

> Small note: an Apple touch icon will look better if you place 20px padding around the icon and add some background color. You can use any image editor to do this.

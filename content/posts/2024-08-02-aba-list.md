Some of the titles of *A Book Apart* are made available publicly for free by their authors, since ABA unfortunately closed doors.

I own some of ABAÂ´s iconic publications, like <cite>Responsive Web Design</cite>,  <cite>HTML for Web Designers</cite>, <cite>Going Offline</cite>, and some more. The content, the short form, the layout, the typesetting, is inspiring. ABA as a publisher, with their excellent authors, were standing out from the crowd for me. 

[Alan Dalton](https://alandalton.github.io/Authors-Apart/index.html) and [Ryan Trimble](https://ryantrimble.com/blog/a-book-apart-books/) each maintain a list with the ABA titles and links to where the books are available now. Some ABA authors do not offer their books for free, but give you a discount. 

Some of the free online books adhere to the styling of the original books. This is because Jeff Eaton wrote an ABA book parser named [<cite>Dancing Queen</cite>](https://github.com/eaton/dq) that will transform the `.epub` format of any ABA book into Markdown. Mat Marquis has an 11ty project [<cite>A Book Depart</cite>](https://github.com/chriscoyier/practical-svg) which will take the Markdown and render the book content as a static site.

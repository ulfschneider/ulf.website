Never to forget about it! I found the quote in *[The Details](https://matthiasott.com/notes/the-details)* by Matthias Ott. Matthias suggests using two important tools: 

1. **Have a clear goal, vision, or principle.** *When you know where you’re going, every task is just a step towards your goal … It can be “we will at all times provide an inclusive user experience” or “our product is and will always be the fastest on the market.”* Stick to your goal.
2. **Always be willing to learn and gradually improve.** *Nobody gets it right the first time, but if you didn’t allocate some time and budget for course corrections, you will never know which details aren’t working yet.  Consequently, your product will never succeed in the long run. So don’t skip your research, build prototypes, test, and iterate.*

- Emil draws "[Snakes with Poison Dots](/emil-drawing/snakes-with-poison-dots/)."
- Max Böck published a boilerplate [Emergency Website Kit](https://mxb.dev/blog/emergency-website-kit/), which, especially these days, aims to provide a quick way to publish critical information with a single HTTP request. The technique has the ability to handle sudden load spikes with maximum resilience.
- The complete "[An Event Apart Washington DC 2019 Sessions](https://aneventapart.com/news/post/the-complete-aea-dc-2019-now-online)" are available online. That´s quite something to study.
- I´ve learned that there is a <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> tag in HTML which <s>can</s> should be used for dates and time to improve semantic HTML.
- A compelling talk from Aaron Gustafson: "[Progressive Web Apps: Where Do I Begin?](https://aneventapart.com/news/post/progressive-web-apps-where-do-i-begin-aea-video)" It´s not mainly about the Service Worker. Aaron is pointing out that a Progressive Web App aims to enhance *– or progress –* an already great experience of a website with performance, less network reliance, offline capabilities, and engagement. It´s a chain of: focusing on what matters most for a particular web page to create a great core experience ([start with words](https://justinjackson.ca/words.html)); writing semantic markup to support the core experience; designing with CSS to support the core experience; and finally using JavaScript to support the core experience.
- [PWA Stats](https://www.pwastats.com) is a community-driven list of stats and news related to Progressive Web Apps.
- Aaron Shekey, Stack Overflow’s principal product designer on design systems, explains how the new [dark mode](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/03/31/building-dark-mode-on-stack-overflow/) of Stack Overflow has been realized.
- [Stacks](https://stackoverflow.design) is the design system of Stack Overflow.
- A beautiful [collection of typespecimens](https://typespecimens.io), curated by John D. Jameson.
- I have added a search function to my static [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)-driven site. It´s a client-side search powered by [Lunr](https://lunrjs.com). Currently the search index for the entire website is built on the client with the first query a user kicks off. This is something that could be improved for the future. But still I´m happy with that thing for now.

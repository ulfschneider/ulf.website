- I published [markdown-it-fitmedia](/tools/markdown-it-fitmedia/), a markdown-it plugin to set aspect-ratio of responsive images, make images lazy loading, and to make videos responsive. Use it in the build process of your static site generator (I´m running it as part of my [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) build).
- This [regex101](https://regex101.com) is very helpful. I´m wondering why I didn´t came across it earlier.
- A collection made by [Trebleseven](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/trebleseven/) with the [works](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/trebleseven/jacqueline-casey/) of Jacqueline Casey (20 April 1927 - 18 May 1992). I´m so impressed.

- Signed [assange-helfen](https://assange-helfen.de/en). A state has been caught in a war crime and for that reason the state takes revenge on the person who helped to reveal everything. Making [Collateral Murder](https://www.nytimes.com/video/multimedia/1248069533084/collateral-murder.html) public was important. Protecting whistleblowers is important.
- Learned about [scroll-margin-top](https://css-tricks.com/fixed-headers-and-jump-links-the-solution-is-scroll-margin-top/) from CSS Tricks.
- Found two designers whose work really resonates with me. There is a lot to learn from [Frank Chimero](https://frankchimero.com) and [Mark Boulton](http://markboulton.co.uk/).
- Published [Compose CSS v3.0.0](/compose).
- Interesting: "[The Evolution of Web Design](https://fabianburghardt.de/webolution/)."
- Have to evaluate [accessible colors](https://accessible-colors.com) for anything with colors.
- Installed [ColorSlurp](http://colorslurp.com) color picker and like the tool.
- Read about how Jonnie Hallmann redesigned his website [destroytoday](https://destroytoday.com). He describes in his [Blog](https://destroytoday.com/blog) that he used Nuxt and Contentful. That´s an interesting choice because I like Vue and couldn´t become a friend of React so far. I´m carrying the idea of running my blog as a PWA for some time now—just to learn it. Therefore I will probably borrow ideas from Jonnie.
- I like the perceived simplicity of Robin Rendle´s [essay design](https://www.robinrendle.com/essays/systems-mistakes-and-the-sea). However, I´m missing a navigation back to his page.
- Had to read about collapsing margins again and found the [explanation from Ire Aderinokun](https://bitsofco.de/collapsible-margins/) very beneficial.
- "It´s not fun anymore…"—Watched a down to earth [Paul Tierney running the Wainwrights](https://youtu.be/laMBEjxlst8). Beautiful landscape, comradery, achievement, and suffering!

[<cite>Sqoosh</cite>](https://squoosh.app) is a progressive web app from GoogleChromeLabs that will reduce the size of your images and convert your images to various formats, like AVIF, Browser GIF, Browser JPEG, Browser PNG, JPEG XL, MozJPEG, OxiPNG, QOI, and WebP. You can also resize and reduce the palette. ==The entire code runs locally in your browser. You are not sharing your images with any server!== The [source is on GitHub](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/squoosh).

> Squoosh does not send your image to a server. All image compression processes locally.  However, Squoosh utilizes Google Analytics to collect the following:
>
> - Basic visitor data.
> - The before and after image size value.
> - If Squoosh PWA, the type of Squoosh installation.
> - If Squoosh PWA, the installation time and date.

Martin and I are riding the [<cite>Westfalen Winter Bike Trophy</cite>](https://westfalen-winter-bike-trophy.org) and this Sunday the first run in a series of 9 events started in Capelle. We were looking forward to this day because it is a nice start into the cycling season of the new year. Every weekend a run is in a different location, so you encounter new places to ride.

The route started in the snow with -2 °C. Beautiful riding. Then the weather changed and it was about +2 °C and raining. We were riding 3 hours in the rain on wet snow and the last hour was a fight to stay warm. Thankfully nothing happened with the equipment. I don´t know how we have managed a flat tire under that conditions. Standing 5 minutes without riding immediately got us so cold that our bodies were shaking. It was not a far ride, only 56 km, but I found this one to be tough. I hope for better weather for the upcoming events.

The cycling club in Capelle did an excellent job of organized the event. The first  control point (which was also the last one) had a loverly catering, and the campfires you see on the image raised my mood. In the finish area hot coffee and delicious cakes were waiting for us, but I first needed to stay like 10 minutes in the arrival room until my body reduced trembling  to an extent that I could eat and drink something.

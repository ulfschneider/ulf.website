Thank You to everyone who is writing free software!  

Free software allows to use, study, share, and improve code by everyone. Feb. 14 is the [<cite>I Love Free Software Day</cite>](https://fsfe.org/activities/ilovefs/index.en.html)! To celebrate the day, to say thank to all the people maintaining, contributing, and advocating to and for free software, the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) invites you to participate the day. You can do that, for example, by [generating a sharepic](https://sharepic.fsfe.org/#ilovefs), like the one below, and put it on your blog. When was the last time youÂ´ve sent a postcard to someone? You can do that with the *free software* [postcards](https://fsfe.org/contribute/spreadtheword.en.html#ilovefs) designed by the FSFE.

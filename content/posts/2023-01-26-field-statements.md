[Statements are better than questions](https://twitter.com/adambsilver/status/1615989706700857344) when labeling fields, because it is less to read and the important details are front-loaded. Also: [Avoid instructions like ‘Enter...’, ‘Select...’, ‘Tell us about...’](https://x.com/adamsilverhq/status/1618156137555148802) because it’s wordier and usually unnecessary.

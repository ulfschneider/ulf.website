CSS, the *awesome* language that controls how HTML looks in the browser, [has a new logo](https://github.com/CSS-Next/logo.css) . The background is `rebeccapurple`, which I find a [beautiful color choice](https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2014/06/19/rebeccapurple/).

At some point there was the idea by Amit Sheen to spill the CSS text [slightly out of the framing container](https://www.ondrejkonecny.com/blog/kind-of-rebeccapurple/), which, as a nod to [CSS is Awesome](https://css-tricks.com/css-is-awesome/), I liked even more. It seems the participants of the discussion disliked the association of CSS with something unpredictable and chaotic, so they refrained from going into that direction. Unfortunately. Here is the [discussion thread](https://github.com/CSS-Next/css-next/issues/105).

Dark mode <q>… is a software option that makes the user interface darker. It changes light backgrounds to a dark color and changes text from dark to light. The result is a pseudo-inverted interface that isn't exactly the opposite of the light mode, but has mostly dark colors.</q>[^tech-terms]

Apple is putting the use of dark mode into an environmental context: <q>Dark Mode is a systemwide appearance setting that uses a dark color palette to provide a comfortable viewing experience tailored for low-light environments.</q>[^apple]

## Reasons for dark mode

There seems to be no evidence for the claim that dark mode in general helps to reduce eye strain. Digital eye strain can be caused by blinking less than usual when looking at a screen. The standard 15-blinks-per-minute can go down to 3.5-blinks-per-minute when staring at a computer screen – contributing to dry eyes with headaches and blurred vision as associated symptoms.[^wired][^bmj]

Still, dark mode has its use dependent on the environment: <q>… the effort of looking at a screen can vary a lot depending on your surroundings. In a dimly lit environment, where the main light source is your screen, the greater the eye strain provoked by a brightly lit display … Conversely, in a brightly lit environment, a darker screen can actually force your eyes to work harder.</q>[^wired]

It can be more convinient to look at a dark screen when being in a darkened environment, like on a train or plane at night. In that way I understand dark mode as an accessibility topic. It helps users working with the computer screen by adjusting to their bodies.

**It is said that dark mode saves energy. **

Another truth is, dark mode is a hype-thing and to a big part it´s driven by aesthetics. While style is important, I wouldn´t want to have, _or build,_ an alternative dark mode in addition to a light mode alone for style reasons. If it doesn´t improve the user experience I want to avoid having the user to toggle appearence settings for a site. The site design should work out of the box.

## How to toggle?

No user interaction should be required to adjust display settings for making a site design work. Therefore I prefer to react on overall system settings when activating dark mode in my site design. All current operating systems have a system-wide setting where a user can configure his or her preference for the screen colors. The _automatic_ setting that would turn on dark mode at sunset and activate light mode at sunrise makes sense in my view.

Even if a change of mode is required inbetween, it should be a system-wide change and thus to be toggled via the operating system and not per each app or website. To react on such system preferences a CSS media query is just enough - no need for JavaScript:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  /* CSS styles for users who prefer dark mode at the OS level */
}
```

There can still be a reason when a dark mode toggle on a website would make sense. In case the operating system doesn´t support automatic or manual dark mode, a user would benefit from having that toggle at least for the website. To build a toggle in a sensible way requires much more effort than reacting on the system dark mode setting.

[<cite>FaceType Foundry</cite>](https://www.facetype.org) has a very simple yet beautiful start page that gives an excellent overview of their creative typefaces. Many are probably best suited for display type. Nearly every type looks interesting to me. To pick some:

[Darjeeling](https://www.facetype.org/?font=darjeeling)
: <q>combines British Elegance and Indian Flavor.</q>

[Blitzplakat](https://www.facetype.org/?font=blitzplakat-2) 
: <q>is the name of a pre-Letraset system, which enabled you to make your own advertising posters by cutting out these letters and sticking them onto paper like stamps.</q>

[Flint](https://www.facetype.org/?font=flint) 
: <q>the typeface from 10.000 BC.</q>

[Ivory](https://www.facetype.org/?font=ivory) 
: <q>is inspired by a beautiful typeface used in an illustrated compendium about pomology from 1882.</q>

[Letterpress](https://www.facetype.org/?font=letterpress)
: <q>meet the letterpress.</q>

[Newcastle](https://www.facetype.org/?font=newcastle) 
: <q>gives you great opportunities for spicy typography. If you find some similarities to one of our fonts, ‘Blitzplakat’, you are right.</q>

[Pinback](https://www.facetype.org/?font=pinback) 
: <q>was inspired by the science fiction movies of the 60s and 70s. The name is taken from one of the protagonists of John Carpenter’s Dark Star.</q>

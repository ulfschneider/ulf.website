RSS is perhaps the most underrated internet  protocol. It´s an easy way to have content from very different authors and websites organized and presented in a single place, the RSS Reader. The reader provides you a chronological view of new content from multiple different websites, without you visiting those sites one by one. By subscribing to a RSS feed you decide what finds its way into your reader  – no one else. The RSS protocol is easy to implement by websites, easy to consume by a reader, and will save your bandwidth and computer resources. *It is wonderful.*

I get aware of a lot of interesting content (at least for me) by following authors I hold in high regards, and everyone of them has a RSS feed attached to their site. It´s difficult for me to follow someone who doesn´t have a feed. My app for reading and synchronizing those feeds across all my Apple devices is [<cite>Reeder</cite>](https://reederapp.com). 

This site also has a [RSS feed](/feed.xml), of course.

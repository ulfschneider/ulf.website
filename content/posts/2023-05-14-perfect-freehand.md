[<cite>perfect-freehand</cite>](https://www.perfectfreehand.com) by [Steve Ruiz](https://github.com/steveruizok) allows to <q>draw perfect pressure-sensitive freehand lines</q> and export them to SVG. You can install it as an npm package and use the `getStroke` function with an array of input points. The `getStroke` will return an array of outline points that form a polygon that surrounds the input points. Checkout the [README](https://github.com/steveruizok/perfect-freehand) on GitHub.

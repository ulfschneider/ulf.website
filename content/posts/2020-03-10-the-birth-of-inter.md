In "[The Birth of Inter](https://www.figma.com/blog/the-birth-of-inter/)" [Rasmus Andersson](https://rsms.me) is explaining his (work)flow and tool usage while developing [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/), a beautiful sans-serif typeface designed for reading text on screens. It is now being used by [GitHub](https://github.com), [Mozilla](https://mozilla.design), and [Figma](http://figma.com), of course. It is open, you can get it from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter).

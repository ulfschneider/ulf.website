Dave Rupert compiled a list of properties that should play a role for [<cite>good forms</cite>](https://daverupert.com/2024/09/good-forms/). Among the many, here are the last five points from DaveÂ´s list:


> - Good forms make the baby Jesus smile
> - Good authenticated forms should have a server-generated nonce value
> - Good forms should do a pre-flight check for navigator.onLine before attempting a submit
> - Good forms start with accent-color for styling and only get more complex if necessary
> - Good forms see custom controls as a radioactive asset that must be removed at the earliest opportunity

Quick notes:

- Align the primary button to the left edge of the inputs
- Put the back button above the form
- Put tangentially related actions above the form (like: forgot password in a login form)
- Place extra buttons based on what they do
- Put the cancel button below the primary button
- Put the add another button above the primary button
- Put the save and exit button next to the primary button
- In single field forms put the button next to the input
- Put buttons on multi-select forms above the form

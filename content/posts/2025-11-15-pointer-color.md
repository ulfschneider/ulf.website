title: Adjust pointer size and pointer color on a Mac

I often struggle to spot the current mouse pointer location. By default the pointer is small and the white color does not have enough contrast. To help with that I change those settings on MacOS in the menu:

System settings → Accessibility → Display → Pointer

There it is possible to set size, border color and fill color for the pointer.

[<cite>Pure Paste</cite>](https://sindresorhus.com/pure-paste) is a tiny *Sindre Sorhus-style* app that sits in the menu bar and clears the formatting of text pasted from the clipboard.

For example, you can paste text into an email and avoid polluting your message with the source formatting. That makes a lot of sense to me and is probably useful in any text-authoring situation.

The app can do even more clever things when pasting. From the following list of options I have activated the ones marked with (on):

- Preserve links
- Remove tracking parameters from URLs (on)
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace
- Normalize quotes (on)
- Normalize newlines (on)
- Normalize unordered lists (on)
- Remove invisible characters (on)
- Remove footnote references (on)
- Remove mailto: prefix from email addresses (on)

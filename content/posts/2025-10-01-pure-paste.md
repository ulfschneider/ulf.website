[<cite>Pure Paste</cite>](https://sindresorhus.com/pure-paste) is a tiny *Sindre Sorhus-style* app that sits in the menu bar and clears the formatting of any text pasted from the clipboard.

You can paste text into an email and avoid polluting your email with the source formatting. That makes a lot of sense to me and is probably useful for any information tool used for text authoring.

The app can do even more clever things during the paste. From the following list of options I have activated the ones marked with (on):
- Preserve links
- Remove tracking parameters from URLs (on)
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace
- Normalize quotes (on)
- Normalize newlines (on)
- Normalize unordered lists (on)
- Remove invisible characters (on)
- Remove footnote references (on)
- Remove mailto: prefix from email addresses (on)

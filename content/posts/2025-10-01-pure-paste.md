[<cite>Pure Paste</cite>](https://sindresorhus.com/pure-paste) is a tiny *Sindre Sorhus-style* app that sits in the menu bar and clears the formatting of any text pasted from the clipboard.

You can paste text into an e-mail and avoid polluting your e-mail with the source formatting. That makes a lot of sense to me and is probably useful for any information tool used for text authoring.

It´s a web.dev course prepared by Jeremy Keith and it´s high quality - like so often when I´m referring to Jeremy´s work. I found the chapter about [Internationalization](https://web.dev/learn/design/internationalization/) particularly interesting. [Typography](https://web.dev/learn/design/typography/) and [Responsive Images](https://web.dev/learn/design/responsive-images/) was also standing out to me.

<blockquote>The goal of responsive design is to make your content available to everyone.

That makes responsive design an accessibility topic as well.

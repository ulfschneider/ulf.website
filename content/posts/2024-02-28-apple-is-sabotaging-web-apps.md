Apple plans to disable Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) on iOS for European users, so that 

- the Push API will no longer work,
- the Badging API will no longer work,
- the Standalone mode will no longer work,
- stored data from PWAÂ´s will get lost.

Apple tries to justify this as a means to comply with the European Digital Markets Act (DMA), which forces Apple to allow different browsers than Safari on iOS. Apple will then treat all browsers in the same way: by disabling PWA support. 

> Degrading these features is not required by the DMA.

You can sign an open letter to Tim Cook to express your concern, and to avail yourself of your rights under the Digital Markets Act (DMA):

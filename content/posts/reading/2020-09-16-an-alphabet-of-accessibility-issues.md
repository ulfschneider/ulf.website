[An Alphabet of Accessibility Issues](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/anne-gibson/2014-july-31), by [Anne Gibson](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/baker/anne-gibson), is a carefully curated list of situations where proper accessibility of a web site would be in support of its readers. Anne´s text helps to create understanding and empathy. I think it falls into the category of *accessibility is helping everyone.*

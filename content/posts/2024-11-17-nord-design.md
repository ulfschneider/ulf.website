The [<cite>Nord Design System</cite>](https://nordhealth.design) is an impressive piece of work. The communication through the design team´s web page is considered.

The footer of the start page has a *Get in touch* section with a link to [contact support](https://nordhealth.design/help/). From there you can drill down into FAQs, slack channels, an email contact point, get informed about office hours, and the API availability status. They also have a contribution process to allow product teams to add new features based on product requirements.

The [design system guidelines](https://nordhealth.design/guidelines/) start with a concrete and actionable [accessibility checklist](https://nordhealth.design/accessibility-checklist/).

The [design system principles](https://nordhealth.design/principles/) are sensible:

> ### Put user needs first
> We care for the people who use our products. We’re here to make their day-to-day and long-term work better and more pleasant through great user experience.
> ### Strive for consistency, not uniformity
> We should use the same language and design patterns wherever possible. This helps people get familiar with our services. Same holds true for the system and its developer experience.
> ### Default to openness
> We should share what we’re doing whenever we can. Building our services transparently increases their visibility and accountability and makes us push towards higher quality.
> ### Make it accessible
> Our services are for everyone. We make sure people with different needs can use our products and that they meet the accessibility standards outlined in WCAG 2.1.
> ### Provide a good developer experience
> Providing a good developer experience is very important to us. Developers should be able to start using our tools in minutes, not hours, days or weeks.
> ### Automate everything you can
> We value the time of our colleagues, users, and our future selves over our own. We are always proactively looking for ways to automate repetitive tasks and testing.

Last, but not least, the design system page provides an RSS feed. 👍

title: <code>name</code> attribute for the <code>details</code> element
tags: code
---
All major browsers now support the `name` attribute for the `<details>` element. 

> This attribute enables multiple `<details>` elements to be connected, with only one open at a time. This allows developers to easily create UI features such as accordions without scripting.
> The name attribute specifies a group name — give multiple `<details>` elements the same name value to group them. Only one of the grouped `<details>` elements can be open at a time — opening one will cause another to close. 
> `<details>` elements don't have to be adjacent to one another in the source to be part of the same group.

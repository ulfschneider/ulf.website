We have a wasps nest under the terrace roof. At first the wasps have been *inside* the roof and I closed the whole they were flying through. Unfortunately new the wasps start creating a new nest. I´m still reluctant but I think I have to remove it. Because Emil was the one who discovered the initial whole in the first place he is very attached to what´s happening. The impression made him creating his own wasps nest with a queen wasp in the center.

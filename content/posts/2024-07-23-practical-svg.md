Chris Coyier makes his book [<cite>Practical SVG</cite>](https://practical-svg.chriscoyier.net) available on the web. Mat Marquis did the same for [<cite>JavaScript for Web Designers</cite>](https://javascript-for-web-designers.abookapart.com).

Chris explains in his post [<cite>Practical SVG is Now Free to Read Online</cite>](https://chriscoyier.net/2024/07/22/practical-svg-is-now-free-to-read-online/), a reason for doing this is unfortunately the closing of the original publisher, A Book Apart. Very interesting is the list of open source tools used to bring the `.epub` version of any A Book Apart book online as an 11ty Jamstack site.

The [<cite>Keyboard Event Viewer</cite>](https://w3c.github.io/uievents/tools/key-event-viewer.html) by the W3C is a great tool to see keyboard events with their modifiers in the browser. Because it is  a website it supports investigating how different browsers on different operating systems handle certain keyboard events.

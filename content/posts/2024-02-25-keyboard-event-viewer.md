The [<cite>Keyboard Event Viewer</cite>](https://w3c.github.io/uievents/tools/key-event-viewer.html) by the W3C is a great tool to track keyboard events with their modifiers in the browser. There is a companion tool named [<cite>Mouse Event Viewer</cite>](https://w3c.github.io/uievents/tools/mouse-event-viewer.html) which allows to track mouse events. Because both tools are websites, they support investigating how different browsers on different operating systems handle those events.

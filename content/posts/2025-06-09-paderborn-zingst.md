## The route

<figcaption>My route from Paderborn to Zingst, which I planned with komoot collections. My collection is named <a href="https://www.komoot.com/de-de/collection/3434196/-paderborn-zingst">Paderborn – Zingst</a>, of course. I divided the route into the four following stages. The figures represent my measured Garmin data.
<ol>
<li>Paderborn to Landesbergen, 127 km, 876 m up</li>
<li>Landesbergen to Bad Bevensen, 150 km, 546 m up</li>
<li>Bad Bevensen to Wismar, 155 km, 804 m up</li>
<li>Wismar to Zingst, 132 km, 537 m up</li>
</ol>

## Day 1, Paderborn to Landesbergen

The route starts in Paderborn and goes through Detmold, Lemgo, and Minden, ending in Landesbergen. My initial plan is to ride 10 km further to Nienburg, but the Mühlengasthof Landesbergen looks inviting to stay for the night, therefore I cut off the route at 127 km for the day.

The rooms are comfortable, the food is good, and the location is calm and friendly. I enjoy having a lively conversation with one of the two owners. During the breakfast of the next day I meet two other cyclists and we talk about bike riding, how the bike must conform to the rider and how the rider has to adapt to the demands of a multi-day bike journey.</figcaption>

## Day 2, Landesbergen to Bad Bevensen

The second day takes me eastward across long stretches of the Southern Heath, below of the Lüneburger Heath. I enjoy riding over the sandy soil through the rather remote landscape. Destination for the day is Bad Bevensen.

## Day 3, Bad Bevensen to Wismar

The third day brings me north, through Naturpark Wendland, Dannenberg, Ludwigslust, then Schwerin, ending in Wismar. I feel the route is long and not varied, with the exception of the part from Schwerin to Wismar, which goes along Lake Schwerin and is beautiful.

<figcaption>Traces of human life along the way. It moves me to see how people shape their surroundings by creating buildings that will change and decay over time. Whoever built the Schwerin Castle is not alive anymore.   The people who created the bus shelter to make life easier for their fellow human beings, they had families, raised children, built houses themselves, and it could be they are no longer with us. Still, someone who will never know the builder, can make use of what that person created.</figcaption>

It makes the individual feel small and insignificant. It serves the ones in power.</figcaption>

## Day 4, Wismar to Zingst

The last day of this journey starts on a chilly but sunny morning in Wismar. From there I ride in eastern direction along the coast of the baltic sea, passing through Kühlungsborn, Heiligendamm, Warnemünde (where I make a quick ferry crossing), then riding further through the Ribnitzer Moor, and finally arriving in Zingst.

## Equipment

A list of selected pieces of equipment that worked pretty well during the ride.

- **Fairlight Secan 3.0:** You might have spotted the bike in the pictures. It’s a steel frame gravel bike that I’ve been riding since the start of this year and I find it super efficient as well as practical. I´m a Fairlight fan for several years and this is my second Secan (with a 56 R frame). The bike is especially great for these kinds of rides because it’s sturdy and has mounting points to attach mud guards or packs. I ride a mechanical Shimano GRX 820 group – no charging required, flawless functionality, always prepared.
- **Specialized Phenom Expert saddle:** A great saddle. No seating issues whatsoever. It´s claimed to be a mountain bike saddle, but you can as well ride it on gravel and road race bikes, it´s so versatile.
- **Ortlieb Fork-Packs:** Whenever I have to pack something on this bike, it starts with the Ortlieb Fork-Packs. I like their minimal impact on the bike handling, which is because they are so deep on the front and because the storage capacity is limited to 5.8 l and 3 kg, each. They have a quick release mechanism for attaching them to the bike as well as detaching, which is overly practical when arriving somewhere to stay for the night. Because it´s Ortlieb you know they keep your items dry when it´s raining.
- **Tailfin Pannier Rack + Tailfin Aero Pack Cargo:** For the current trip I had to pack more than what fits into the Fork-Packs. I ended up to solve this with the most expensive solution, a Tailfin Pannier Rack with an Aero Pack Cargo. I can assure you, when you are willing to pay the money you get an excellent rear packing system that is designed through and through. The rack is light and strong (I used the aluminium version), and it holds the attached pack without swaying by any means. The rack stands on a special thru axle so that it does not use the bike frame for taking the load. It is attached with a quick release system but I did not use that during the journey. The rolltop pack, similar to the Ortlieb Fork-Packs, can be attached and detached to the rack with another quick release system, which I used every day when arriving and when starting to ride. The rolltop closing mechanism of the pack itself is flexible and can be used with gloves. The expandable outer pockets allow to carry small or compressible items you want to have in short reach. The closing-straps are replaceable, as well as some parts of the rack. I cannot say anything about the waterproofness, because it did not rain during my journey, but I expect the pack is fine in this area too. I found this system to be very practical.

  </figure>
- **aerycs GCX Terra 40 wheels:**  They are hand-built near Hamburg. I have them with the DT-Swiss 350 hubs, which I think are excellent and reliable work horse hubs. The wheels are well built and I found they ride lovely.

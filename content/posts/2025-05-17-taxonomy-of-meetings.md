[<cite>A tiny taxonomy of meetings</cite>](https://adactio.com/journal/21905) by Jeremy Keith. Three types of meetings:

1. **Divergent meetings:** Generate ideas.
2. **Convergent meetings:** Come to a decision.
3. **Chemistry Meetings:** No tangible output. Get to know each other.

ItÂ´s a good idea to communicate upfront what type of meeting you are planning to have to help avoiding frustration among participants about the meeting outcome.

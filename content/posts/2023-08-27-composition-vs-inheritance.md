Steven Lowe has an article on the ThoughtWorks blog, elaborating on [<cite>Composition vs. Inheritance: How to Choose?</cite>](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/composition-vs-inheritance-how-choose) The text covers examples of how to misuse inheritance.

## Composition

In my words: ==Use composition for <em>has-a</em> relationships==.

## Inheritance

> Inheritance captures semantics (meaning) in a classification hierarchy (a taxonomy), arranging concepts from generalized to specialized. […] This makes the subclass more tightly coupled to its superclass than it would be if it merely used an instance of the superclass as a component instead of inheriting from it. […] Inheritance captures mechanics by encoding the representation of the data (fields) and behavior (methods) of a class and making it available for reuse and augmentation in subclasses. Mechanically, the subclass will inherit the implementation of the superclass and thus also its interface.

In my words: ==Use inheritance for <em>is-a</em> relationships==. By Steven´s guidance, inheritance should only be used when:

- Both classes are in the ==same logical domain==
- The subclass is a ==proper subtype== of the superclass
- The superclass’s implementation is ==necessary or appropriate== for the subclass
- The enhancements made by the subclass are ==primarily additive==.

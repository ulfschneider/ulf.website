Among the *many* clipboard managers for Mac I´m using [<cite>Maccy</cite>](https://maccy.app) by [Alex Rodionov](https://p0deje.gumroad.com). It costs $9.99 in the App Store. Some design decisions make the app very special:

1. It is focused on one job to do: manage your clippings with minimal distraction, and it does that very well.
2. It follows a keyboard-first approach.
3. It is open source. You can [access the project and its documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/p0deje/Maccy). From there you can even [download the installable app](https://github.com/p0deje/Maccy/releases/tag/0.29.2)! It´s also possible to install with homebrew via `brew install maccy`. 

Alex is so open and fair and the app seems to be written with a lot of attention to detail that it´s an easy decision for me to buy the app and support the development. It´s a pleasure to support individual makers who do things for a purpose and for the joy of it.

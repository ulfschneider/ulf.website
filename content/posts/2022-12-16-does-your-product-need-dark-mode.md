> Dark mode is like being friends with the cool kid. Youâ€™ll probably get some attention and gain some popularity in the short term, but will they be there when things get tough? Will they bring value to your life? They most certainly can, but that depends on how well you choose your cool friend.

[<cite>Does Your Product Actually Need Dark Mode?</cite>](https://www.commandbar.com/blog/dark-mode-considerations), by Cristina Bunea, explores dark mode. I consider dark mode an accessibility feature, because in my perception, when working in a dark environment, like while on a train at night, dark mode is more pleasant to the eye. Of course, in a bright environment a bright screen again makes more sense. Therefore it should be possible to switch light mode and dark mode, or, let the operating system switch automatically.

I came across Ariel SalminenÂ´s [rules for a remote first engineering culture](https://arie.ls/2023/leading-successful-product-teams/). That certainly resonates. I like

> - Avoid meetings as much as possible.
> - Provide at least three days of focus time per week for designers and developers in the team. There should be no interruptions whatsoever during this time. Let them do their work.
> - Too much process and it will slow down your team and their performance.
> - Use as few tools and platforms as possible.
> - Focus on persistent iteration over flashy launches.
> - Be kind.

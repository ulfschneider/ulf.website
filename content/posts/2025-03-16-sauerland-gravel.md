Last weekend was excellent weather, it was sunny and 16 °C, which was 10 °C warmer than the average for the time of the year. I thought doing an overnighter with the Gravel bike would be a great welcoming of spring. I rode to my home-village in the Sauerland region, visiting my mother, getting great food, and traveling back the next day.

One of the great things about a gravel bike, especially when exploring new roads or covering long distances, is its ability to handle almost any terrain. This versatility not only expands your route options but also gives you greater flexibility on your journey, making for a more dynamic and adventurous riding experience.

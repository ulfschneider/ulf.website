[Syncthing](https://syncthing.net) is a tool to synchronize *multiple* folders between different computers with same or different operating systems. It is
- open source,
- the synchronized data is sent peer-to-peer, the data is not transferred across a centralized server, 
- the setup of the tool is a breeze, you will be surprised how quick and smooth,
- the syncing itself is quick and flawless,
- security is one of the [primary project goals](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/security.html).

👌 The tool is so good, you should give it a try! I got aware via the following tweet:

Diana Larsen, author of [<cite>Liftoff: Launching Agile Teams and Projects</cite>](https://agileweekly.com/interviews/episode-36-liftoff-with-ainsley-nies.html), comments to start teams by understanding purpose, alignment, and context. She is adding the questions:

- How does the work of this team fit into biz direction?  
- Who is depending on our work and vice versa?

I think Diana´s first remark could be a sub-topic of <q>Why do we exist?</q> and her second would go into <q>What are we planning to do?</q>

I enjoyed Juan Diego RodriguezÂ´ [<cite>CSS Blob Recipes</cite>](https://css-tricks.com/css-blob-recipes) on CSS Tricks. I learned, each  `border-radius` corner can be addressed with a vertical and horizontal radius! Like:

```css
.blob {
  /* set the horizontal radius to 25% and the vertical to 50%
  border-top-left-radius: 25% 50%; 
}
```  

To address each corner with the two radii, the syntax is:

```css
.blob {
  border-radius:
  /* separate horizontal radii from vertical radii with a forward slash */    
    /* horizontal */
    30% 70% 70% 30% /  
    /* vertical */
    30% 26% 74% 70%;
  /* set width, height, and background */  
  width: 15rem;   
  height: 15rem;  
  background: linear-gradient(47deg, #639 0%, 72%, #0ff 100%);
}
```

which would create the following shape: 

<figure>
<div style="border-radius: 30% 70% 70% 30% / 30% 26% 74% 70%; width:15rem; height:15rem; background:linear-gradient(47deg, #639 0%, 72%, #0ff 100%);"  ></div>
<figcaption>A blob</figcaption>
</figure>

Nils Binder made a tool named [<cite>Fancy-Border-Radius</cite>](https://9elements.github.io/fancy-border-radius/), to easily create such blobs. Nils not only wrote the tool, but also a great article, titled [<cite>CSS Border-Radius Can Do That?</cite>](https://9elements.com/blog/css-border-radius-can-do-that/). From that text I learned it is important for the radii percentage values to add up to 100% for each of the four sides of the shape, to produce an organic looking blob with no straight lines!

Amsterdam Sans will be [the new typeface for the City of Amsterdam](https://www.thonik.nl/stories/a-new-typeface-for-the-city-of-amsterdam/). thonik, the Amsterdam based collective of designers, together with Bold Monday developed the typeface. Amsterdam Sans will replace the Avenir typeface by Adrian Frutiger. As thonik explains:

> <p>In the last twenty years more and more communication is screen based and the Avenir, with its extreme long ascenders, is not so ideal for that.</p>
> <p>The Amsterdam Sans is designed in such a way that it looks like a continuity of the Avenir, but it is better suited for communication on screen, takes less space, has its own distinctive characteristics and is easier to read.</p>

Amsterdam Sans is in use on [amsterdam.nl](https://www.amsterdam.nl).

[<cite>OpenMoji</cite>](https://openmoji.org): Open source emojis for designers, developers and everyone else!

You get the emoji in SVG and PNG format (colored and black), and as a font. The website with the emoji library is nicely made and a free [iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/openmoji/id1462636288) can be used in addition.

OpenMoji is an open-source project of 50+ students and 2 professors of the [HfG Schwäbisch Gmünd](https://www.hfg-gmuend.de) (Design University) and external contributers.

The idea of polling for something in JavaScript until a condition becomse true, like described in the blog post [<cite>JavaScript waitFor Polling</cite>](https://davidwalsh.name/waitfor) by David Walsh, has long been on my list of things to be useful at some point. This week I had a use case within a Vue/TypeScript frontend app. DavidÂ´s code works like a charme! I did some adjustments for TypeScript syntax.


```ts
export async function waitFor(condition: () => any, pollMillis = 50, timeoutMillis?: number) {
  const startTime = Date.now()

  while (true) {
    //check timeout first
    if (timeoutMillis !== undefined && Date.now() > startTime + timeoutMillis) {
      throw `Condition ${condition} not met before timeout of ${timeoutMillis} ms`
    }

    //check condition
    const result = await condition()
    if (result) {
      return result
    }

    //wait for pollMillis until doing the next check of the condition
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, pollMillis))
  }
}
```

I used it like:

```ts
//go ahead from here only if no loading operation is in progress
await waitFor(
	() => loadingStore.loading == false, 
	//check the above condition every 500 milliseconds
	//and do not set a timeout to end the polling
	500)
```

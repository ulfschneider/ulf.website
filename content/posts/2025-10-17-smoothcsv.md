This feels like Markdown for spreadsheets: [<cite>SmoothCSV</cite>](https://smoothcsv.com) is a cross-platform app made by [kohii](https://github.com/kohii), which allows to comfortably edit `.csv` files.

`.csv` files are text files that can be created, read, and shared with any tool capable of handling text. SmoothCSV can pick up and create `.csv`  files with a comprehensive editing experience – on Mac and Windows. SmoothCSV is fast, probably because it´s written in Rust. kohii explains how he created the tool in his dev.to article [<cite>The Technology Behind SmoothCSV - The Ultimate CSV Editor</cite>](https://dev.to/kohii/the-technology-behind-smoothcsv-the-ultimate-csv-editor-3lg0).

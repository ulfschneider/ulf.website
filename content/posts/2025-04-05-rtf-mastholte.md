<figcaption>The <a href="https://rsc-mastholte.de/ ">RSC Mastholte</a> prepared the beautiful course, and the catering :-). Soon Lutz and I were in a group that was led by strong riders of the <a href="https://www.rsc-rietberg.de">Rietberg Cycling Club</a>. The guys did all the work in the wind for nearly the entire ride. We came back from the 115 km course at an avg. speed of 32 km/h, and that´s for a reason – in 2024 the Rietbergers took the first place among all clubs in Germany by riding 94,489 kilometers within one year.</figcaption>

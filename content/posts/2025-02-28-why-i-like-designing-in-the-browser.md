Tyler Sticka: [<cite>Why I like designing in the browser</cite>](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/why-i-like-designing-in-the-browser/). I couldn´t agree more.

My notes of the advantages Tyler mentions when designing in the browser:

- **True to life:** Most design tools only approximate how the end result will look and feel. When already working with HTML and CSS, there is no guessing.
- **No waiting:** Current browser features can immediately be used. No waiting until they arrive in design tools.
- **Markup is fast and functional from the start:**  It´s possible to stub the majority of an interface´s building blocks with a small amount of basic HTML. Plus, that foundation can be surprisingly functional: I get links, accordions and various input types for free.
- **HTML is fluid by default:** HTML was already responsive when Tim Berners-Lee invented it, while design tools tend to assume static canvases of a fixed size, which is against the web.
- **Avoid artificial pixel work:** CSS encourages to express dimensions by intent, leaving most of the math to the browser.
- **The cascade:** CSS allows to change the styling with very few adoptions in the CSS code.
- **Shareable:** Browser-based mockups are portable and shareable, because they rely on open standards and not on proprietary design tools. Recipients only need a browser to view and experience your design.
- **Inspectable:** A developer can open the browser dev tools and analyze all the details of the current design.

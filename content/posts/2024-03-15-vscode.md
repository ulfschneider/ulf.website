My coding environment is [<cite>Visual Studio Code</cite>](https://code.visualstudio.com). I think that´s not a particular fancy choice and I do not get excited about it. To me it´s kind of an okay-choice. When writing software in a team, in my experience it´s most common developers are running VSCode. When everyone is on the same IDE it´s more easy to share the same settings and plugins, so that every developer has the same environment and the code is formatted and linted by the same rules. Failure situation are more easy to track down because you only have to take care of a single IDE. VSCode doesn´t cost money and has many plugins,. and I do not have issues with how it´s working.

I code JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. An alternate choice could be JetBrains WebStorm, or even JetBrains Fleet, which is in a public preview currently. I think the WebStorm folks are writing excellent IDE´s and when you are inside of their ecosystem and complement the IDE with their other tools, and all your programmer colleagues are doing the same, I assume that would work pretty fine. I´m just not used to it. Every now and then I´ve seen colleagues using JetBrains and it looked like JetBrains is going one step further to support developers with a higher level of automation.

[<cite>The Human in the Loop</cite>](https://thedesignteam.io/the-human-in-the-loop-4fe88b16c64d), by Pablo Stanley.

> The LLM writes, reviews, and rewrites its own code. But when it gets stuck, it really gets stuck. Fixing a small bug can spiral into an endless loop — or a full rewrite of the whole project. And you can’t step in, because you don’t speak the language fluently. You just nod along, hoping the next retry works. […] I jokingly tell our dev team I’m a hacker (they silently hate me a bit haha). But I’ve also gained a deep respect for them — the real programmers. The stuff AI does today is built on decades of human work. And when things break, it’s still the humans who fix it… for now.

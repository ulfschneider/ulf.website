Mikhail describes his font as:

>	This font is a crossover of different font types: it is semi-condensed, semi-rounded, semi-geometric, semi-din, semi-grotesque. It employs minimal stroke thickness variations and a semi-closed aperture. The fourth version of the font comes in a Variable Font format, and 7 legacy weights.

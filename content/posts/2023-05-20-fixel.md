<img src="/img/fonts/fixel.png" alt="A type sample of Fixel, stating: Fixel is a typeface in two styles, Text and Display, and offers nine weight options ranging from Thin to Black. Its distinctive feature is a unique combination of geometric and humanist grotesques, which results in open letter forms, wide width, crisp edges, and low contrast, striking a balance between restraint and a sense of playfulness and dynamism. We intentionally designed Fixel typeface to avoid being overly expressive for improved use with large volumes of text. Nevertheless, certain symbols such as the letters "a" and "g" have distinctive features that make Fixel stand out. In addition to the standard set of letterforms, the typeface also includes alternative symbols.">

Again, again, Oliver made me aware with his [font friday](https://pimpmytype.com/fixel/), which was about Fixel this time. Fixel has interesting stylistic alternates, and, as Oliver is pointing out: <q>Compared to Neue Helvetica, the apertures of e and a of Fixel are more open. The typeface is also wider and seems softer.</q> The alternates are activated with CSS   `font-feature-settings: "salt", "ss01";` Fixel is available in a display style and in a text style.

Second run of the series. The weather was much better than last week in Capelle. A beautiful track winding through an industrially sculpted landscape. Top notch organization and catering by the cycling club RSC Werne.  I was again riding with Martin (a.k.a Capitano), which usually requires pushing harder and riding faster.

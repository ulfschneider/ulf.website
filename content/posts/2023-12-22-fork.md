My Git client is [<cite>Fork</cite>](https://fork.dev). It is well maintained by Tanya Pristupova and Dan Pristupov. Fork is available for Windows and MacOs, which was important for me, as I work in both environments. The tool will not get in your way, which is good. I donÂ´t feel like I need anything else as a Git client.

My Git client is [<cite>Fork</cite>](https://fork.dev). It is well maintained by Tanya Pristupova and Dan Pristupov. Fork is available for Windows and MacOs, which is important for me, as I work in both environments (with a strong preference for Mac, I use Windows only when I´m forced to). The tool will not get in your way. I don´t need anything else as a Git client.

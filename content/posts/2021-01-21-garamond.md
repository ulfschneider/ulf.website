[Georg Duffner](http://www.georgduffner.at) provided an open source of [EB Garamond](http://www.georgduffner.at/ebgaramond/index.html), which is a beautiful humanist typeface, originating back to the mid 16th century. Massimo Vignelli has it in his [small set of essential typefaces](/assets/the-vignelli-canon.pdf) he is using in his work. EB Garmanond is available at [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/EB+Garamond).

Spitfire is a virtual whiteboard to be shared by multiple people at the same time. Users will be anonymous – so no one needs to sign in.

Spitfire can be used as a simple task board, in agile retrospectives or brainstorming sessions, simply whenever teams are working across different locations and want to have immediate feedback on content change.

Go to [spitfire.peewee.space](http://spitfire.peewee.space), create a whiteboard session, and share the URL with the people you want to work with. Anyone who has access to that URL can participate in your work.

Spitfire is free to use for everyone. I am building it on top of the [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com) platform while obeying the agile mantra: _Make the simplest thing that will possibly work now. Validate. Repeat. Yay._ Spitfire is Open Source. Find the code on [GitHub](http://github.com/ulfschneider/spitfire).

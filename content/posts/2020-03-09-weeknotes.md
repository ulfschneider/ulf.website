- This guy [Jack McDade](https://jackmcdade.com/) knows how to design a web page. Jack made [Justin Jackson´s page](https://justinjackson.ca), which I think is an exceptional piece of work. Wow. Jack is also working on a [radical design course](https://radicaldesigncourse.com). What could be the name of the style – *delicate brutalism?*
- Reading Jonathan Snook´s take on a [magazine grid](https://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/playing-with-css-grid). Jonathan is pointing out himself that popping out random articles in bigger size might irritate users and I have the same concern. I think all sizes and layout should have a meaning. 
- Keir Watson is describing his process to produce a [magazine grid](https://css-tricks.com/responsive-grid-magazine-layout-in-just-20-lines-of-css/) with similar properties in incredible detail on CSS Tricks. In fact his CSS grid code does a lot of things in an excellent way while it is only 20 lines long. His explanation however, is multi-page long. 
- Andy Bell describes a technique to [break out of the mould of your fixed-width container to create visual interest](https://piccalil.li/tutorial/creating-a-full-bleed-css-utility/).
- I learned there are [keywords for defining system fonts](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/font/#article-header-id-1) in CSS, e.g. <code>caption</code>, <code>menu</code>, and <code>message-box</code>.
- [11ty](https://11ty.dev), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) and probably [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox) could be a combination to be used for a nice blog rebuild project, which would eventually turn into a PWA. People seem to be satisfied with 11ty+Netlify.
- Because of the Coronavirus many people are staying away from the office now. Working from home. Not travelling anymore. Change in behavior and perception. I was talking to Petr, a colleague from Czech Republic, and he told me it´s not allowed to cross the country borders for 3 months from now and schools are closed for 2 months. In Germany schools will be closed for 5 weeks at least. Public events are cancelled, people are doing hamster purchase. Slowly it´s getting scary, though personally I don´t know anyone being infected. I realize that our way of living is not for granted. I´m getting reminded to the book "Blindness" from José Saramago, where a city is hit by an epidemic "white blindness." A book I enjoyed reading. "The Plague" from Albert Camus could also be something to read again – I think I´ve done it 35 years ago.

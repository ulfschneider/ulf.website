> Paris-Brest-Paris. 1230 Kilometers, at a stretch, day and night, in 90 hours maximum, 6000 randonneurs fighting hills, fatigue and the ticking clock.

Beautiful. I watched this film the first time some years ago and then again recently with my son Emil. Later I learned, one of the main actors, [Claus Czycholl](https://www.altonaer-bicycle-club.de/news/index.php?id=746999829110095872), unfortunately passed away on March 1, 2024, at the age of 81.

The movie page on [curlypictures.com](https://curlypictures.de/project/brevet/) has nice impressions. In the past the film could be purchased through [vimeo.com](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/brevet), but I think that is not possible anymore, at least in Germany. Other places to get the film are [amazon.de](https://www.amazon.de/Brevet-cant-just-keep-going/dp/B019N58PE0/) and [norockjustroll.com](https://www.norockjustroll.com/epages/78358756.sf/en_GB/?ObjectPath=/Shops/78358756/Products/009).

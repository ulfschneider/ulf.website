Geometries of bikes I find interesting. For comparison my reference is the <span class="mark">Rose XEON TEAM GF 57 road marathon bike</span>, which I´m riding for multiple years now. ^[When you don´t find the geometry data for older bikes on the manufacturers page, bike geometries can be looked up at [geometrygeeks.bike](https://geometrygeeks.bike)]

<tr><td>Fairlight Strael 3.0 (tall)</td><td>James Hayden, the two-times winner of the Transcontinental, rode a Strael. It´s a steel bike weighing under 9 kilo´s. Fairlight offers the regular and tall geometries, which I think is an incredible commitment to rider needs. Their design notes, written by Dom Thomas who is the bike designer of Fairlight cycles, really speak to me. After being interested in Fairlight and the Strael for multiple years now, I ordered a frame which will probably arrive by March 2022.</td><td>56</td><td>600</td><td>380</td><td>73.5</td><td>73</td><td>57</td><td>418</td><td>1002</td><td>68</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fairlight Secan 2.0 (tall)</td><td>James Hayden won the Italy Divide (together with Sofiane Seihill) on a Secan.</td><td>56</td><td>610</td><td>385</td><td>73.5</td><td>72</td><td>60.7</td><td>430</td><td>1034</td><td>77</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Santa Cruz Stigmata 2021</td><td>It´s not important for the geo, but the color schemes for 2022 are awful.</td><td>56</td><td>596</td><td>388</td><td>73.5</td><td>72</td><td>57</td><td>425</td><td>1025</td><td>72</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cannondale Synapse 2022</td><td>The 2022 version has a standard 27.2 seatpost and a threaded bottom bracket! The Cannondale website is appealing.</td><td>56</td><td>590</td><td>387</td><td>73</td><td>73.2</td><td>57</td><td>415</td><td>998</td><td>73</td><td class="mark">Yes</td></tr>

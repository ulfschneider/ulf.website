title: Quicksearch in iA Writer

Today I learned there is a quicksearch in iA Writer, which seems to work in a fuzzy search mode. E.g., when I search for **play** I also get result entries that contain **lay**out. 

Open the qicksearch with <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> <kbd>O</kbd>. The search results are divided into a first section containing matches for library path names of your files, and into a second section containing search matches for text inside of your files. 

Up to now I always used the filter functionality at the bottom of the library. The added benefit of the quicksearch is the separation of the results into file name and content matches.

You can get a list with all keyboard shortcuts at [<cite>Shortcuts</cite>](https://ia.net/writer/support/basics/shortcuts).

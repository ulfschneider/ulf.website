title: Quicksearch in iA Writer

Today I learned there is a quicksearch in iA Writer, which seems to work in a fuzzy search mode. E.g., when I search for **play** I also get result entries that contain **lay**out. Open the qicksearch with <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> <kbd>O</kbd>. You can get a list with all keyboard shortcuts at [<cite>Shortcuts</cite>](https://ia.net/writer/support/basics/shortcuts).


Up to now I always used the filter functionality at the bottom of the library.

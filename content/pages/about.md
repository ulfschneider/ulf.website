Welcome! My name is Ulf Schneider and this is my website. I´m a software developer and agile coach.

At this place I´m taking notes about things that resonate with me, like web development, [web accessibility](/2020-08-21-my-approach-to-accessibility/), [agile software development](/blog/agile/), and fast bicycles. My most recent _riding tool_ is a [Fairlight Strael](/2024-09-14-strael-morph/) steel-bike build.

Writing this blog is helping me [clarify my thoughts](/2023-05-18-blogging/). Over time, it became the _external memory_ of topics I want to have in short reach. Because I get so much inspiration and valuable information from people who are sharing their thoughts via their blogs, I also want to contribute by making available what I have. You might find that useful, or not.

This site is also my playing field for web technologies. It´s here, where I implemented my first _service worker_. I enjoy exploring new topics in web development by experimenting and integrating them here into my personal site, which is based on the [Jamstack](/2022-09-28-jamstack-in-20-minutes/) and built with [11ty](https://11ty.dev).

Every now and then my son Emil makes a drawing, which I aim to [capture here](/gallery/emil-drawing/). Emil created a picture of [the virus](/2020-03-18-emil-pictured-the-coronavirus/) at the beginning of the Corona pandemic. Emil also made a drawing of a [smiling unicorn](/2021-10-22-a-smiling-unicorn-with-a-kite/).

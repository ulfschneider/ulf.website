Welcome! My name is Ulf Schneider and this is my website. I´m a software developer and agile coach.

At this place I´m taking notes about things that resonate with me, like web development, [web accessibility](/2020-08-21-my-approach-to-accessibility/), [agile software development](/blog/agile/), and fast bicycles. My most recent _riding tool_ is a [Fairlight Strael](/blog/strael/) steel-bike build.

Writing this blog helps me [clarifying my thoughts](/2023-05-18-blogging/). Over time, it became the _external memory_ of topics I want to have in short reach. Because I get so much inspiration and valuable information from people who are sharing their thoughts via their blogs, I also want to contribute by making available what I have. You might find that useful, or not.

This site is also my playing field for web technologies. It´s here, where I implemented my first _service worker_. I enjoy exploring new topics in web development by experimenting and integrating them here into my personal site. Since some time I like the [Jamstack](/2022-09-28-jamstack-in-20-minutes/).

Every now and then my son Emil makes a drawing, which I aim to [capture here](/images/emil-drawing/). Emil created a picture of [the virus](/2020-03-18-emil-pictured-the-coronavirus/) at beginning of the Corona pandemic. Emil also made a drawing of a [smiling unicorn](/2021-10-22-a-smiling-unicorn-with-a-kite/).

This site does not use Cookies. I´m proud it has a service worker on board – so it´s a _Progressive Web App._ It is built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) on a Mac, stored on [Github](https://github.com) and served by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). The fulltext search is powered [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app). The typeface is [iA Writer Quattro](https://ia.net/topics/a-typographic-christmas). The font size will adjust at certain breakpoints to your window size and has been calculated with the [Type Scale Calculator](https://typescale.com) and a major third scale. The type scale is not fluid. I write [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) with [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) and all code with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). The CSS toolkit is [Tailwind CSS](/2023-01-24-my-first-attempt-with-tailwind-css/). [Prism](https://prismjs.com) is used for syntax highlighting of code blocks.

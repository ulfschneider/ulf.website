I build and share these tools. You may want to have a quick look at:

- [Breakdown for Atom](/tools/breakdown/)
- [Spitfire](/tools/spitfire/)

[Compose CSS](/tools/compose/) might also be interesting for you, but expect this to change often, as it is currently in early stage. I´m trying to find out for myself what is useful to have in a CSS library and how that lib should be structured. *{{site.name}}* is created by using Compose CSS.

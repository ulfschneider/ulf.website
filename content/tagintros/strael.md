It is my great pleasure to ride a Fairlight Strael. I´ve built up my first Strael during Spring 2022. Now I´m riding my second Strael, a Strael 4.0, which I built up in May 2025. My experiences with the Straels are collected here. You will find connections to the [Secan](/blog/secan/), which is Fairlight´s fast gravel bike that is also in my stable.
